The basic definition of customer empathy is the ability to identify a customerâ€™s emotional need or state, understand the reasons behind this state, and respond to it effectively and appropriately. These emotional needs can include personal feelings toward the company, interaction, or products the business has exchanged with the customer. It also can be a single problem with the interaction. The customer empathy should be addressed before, during and after the interaction with the customer to give her the best experience possible with the company and its representatives.
