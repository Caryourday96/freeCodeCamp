## How to create PlaceHolders

Originally we had to depend on javascript to create Placeholders. 
You can set the calue attribute how you see fit but as soon as the user deletes the text and clicks away 
,the input will be left blank again. The <code> placeholder </code>  attribute remedies this.


```html

<input name="email" type="email" placeholder="doug@givethesepeopleair.com" />

```

Support across browsers is limited. Firefox and opera don't currently support the placeholder attribute.
